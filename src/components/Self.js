            My name is Gang Liu. You can call me Sam. I just graduated from
            school with a Computer Science A.S. degree. Last year, I finished
            The Odin Project with pretty amazing front-end, back-end, and
            full-stack projects. I am seeking a Web Developer or Computer
            Science related job right now. I am very motivated to learn and
            code.
