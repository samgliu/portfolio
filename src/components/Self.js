                My name is Sam Liu. I graduated from school with a Computer
                Science A.S. degree in Dec. 2021. Meanwhile, I built excellent
                web applications while following a full-stack path in The Odin
                Project, an open-source coding curriculum. I am seeking a web
                development job and am very motivated to learn and code.
